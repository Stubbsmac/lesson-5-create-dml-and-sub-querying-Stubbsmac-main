# CIS250_Create05_DML and Subqueries
For this assignment you will be using a jupyter notebook to learn, practice, and create queries that insert, update, and delete date from a table. We will also be exploring how to use a query as a datasource for another query by subquerying data. You will be using the Airport and Storage Rental database tables for these queries. To assist with query creation, the documentation for both of these tables has been added to the repo. There is a set of exercises and a scenario at the end of the starter file that will be graded. The rest of the jupyter notebook file is for you to practice and prepare for the graded exercises.

## If Something Goes Wrong
Please contact your instructor if something goes wrong. Since we are doing exercises that effect the integrity of the data in your databases there may be operations that you are not able to undo. If you delete or alter data in your database in an unintended way, please reach out as soon as you possible.

## Before Starting
1. Ensure that you have completed the practice assignment succesfully.
2. Complete the Practice Jupyter Notebook assignment.

## Assignment Description
* There are a total of four exercises and one scenario that you will complete.
* Each exercise/scenario is expressed as a business need that you must write a query to satisfy.


## Assignment Requirements
* You must write all of your scripts in the Create file and check it into github
* For full credit your scripts must return the requested result exactly
* You must use best practices in your scripts. Proper casing, spacing, and formatting are required.

## Tips
* The first few rows of the expected output are embedded in the notebook so that you can check your solution.
* Always include a WHERE condition when updateing and deleting data
* If you get stuck, make a post in the Homework Help channel in Teams.
